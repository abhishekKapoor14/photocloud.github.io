        <h2>Basic Photography</h2>
        <p>Photography Basics is like a book, and it reads from front to back. Each chapter of the guide builds on
            prior chapters. If you start at the very beginning and work your way through, the information will flow
            naturally and in the right order. However, if you want to learn something more specific, you’re welcome
            to skip ahead to a later chapter. Here is the overall organization of the guide:</p>

        <h2>Portraiture</h2>
        <p>Portrait photography is one of the most popular genres of photography, with good reason. Good portrait
            photographers are able to capture the personality and emotion of people around them, along with earning
            money
            via wedding photography, senior portraits, family photography sessions, and so on. Below, you’ll find
            everything
            we’ve written about portrait photography, intended for both beginners and professionals.</p>

        <h2>Event Photography</h2>
        <p>
            Very basically, an event photographer specializes in capturing pictures of events. How you define an “event”
            is entirely up to you. Some people would consider weddings, concerts, and sports as part of the event
            photography definition, and in a broad sense, they’re right. But if you focus on weddings or sports, brand
            yourself as such as a photographer. In industry terms, a self-described event photographer is generally
            associated with corporate events.</p>

        <h2>Landscape Photography</h2>
        <p>Landscape photography conveys the appreciation of the world through beautiful imagery of the nature that can
            be
            comprised of mountains, deserts, rivers, oceans, waterfalls, plants, animals and other scenery or life.
            While most landscape photographers strive to show the pureness of nature without any human influence, given
            how
            much of the world has been changed by humans, depicting the nature together with man-made objects can also
            be
            considered a form of landscape photography.</p>

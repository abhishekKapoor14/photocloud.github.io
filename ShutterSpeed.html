    <h3>Introduction To Shutter Speed</h3>
    <br>

            <br>
            One of the three most important settings in photography is Shutter Speed, the other two being Aperture and
            ISO. Shutter speed is responsible for two particular things: changing the brightness of your photo, and
            creating dramatic effects by either freezing action or blurring motion. In the following article, we will
            explain everything you need to know about it in very simple language.</b></p>
    <br>
    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto"
        src="welcomeToShutterSpeed.jpg" alt="concept of shutter speed">
    <p class=lead><b>From this frame you can easily relate the concept of shutter speed, When you increase the shutter
            speed it will absorb more light and if you are decreasing the value of shutter speed sensor will sense less
            light.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p class=lead>
        <b>Shutter speed exists because of camera shutter – which is a curtain in front of the camera sensor that stays
            closed until the camera fires. When the camera fires, the shutter opens and fully exposes the camera sensor
            to
            the light that has passed through your lens. After the sensor is done collecting the light, the shutter
            closes
            immediately, stopping the light from hitting the sensor. The button that fires the camera is also called
            “shutter” or “shutter button,” because it triggers the shutter to open and close.</b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is Shutter Speed?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class=lead><b>Shutter speed is the length of time camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor.
            Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important effects in how your
            images will appear.</b></p>
    <br>
    <h3>How to Set Shutter Speed?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class=lead>
        Most cameras handle shutter speeds automatically by default. When the camera is set to “Auto” mode, the
        shutter speed is selected by the camera without your input (and so are aperture and ISO). However, you can
        still set shutter speed manually if necessary:</p>

    <p>1.By setting the camera to “Shutter Priority” mode, you choose the shutter speed, and the camera
        automatically
        selects the aperture.</p>
    <p>2.By setting the camera to “Manual” mode, you choose both shutter speed and aperture manually.</p>
    <br>
    Within both of these modes, you can choose to set ISO manually or automatically.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class=lead>In most cases, we recommend letting the camera select the correct shutter speed for you. Still, watch
        to be
        certain that you aren’t introducing too much motion blur in a photo (or freezing motion that you want to be
        blurred). I cover more of this in an article on camera modes, but I tend to shoot in “Aperture Priority”
        mode 95% of the time, letting the camera calculate the shutter speed automatically.</p>
    <h3>How to Find Shutter Speed?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class=lead>Do you know how to find what your camera shutter speed is set to? It is typically very easy to find
        it. On cameras that have a top panel, the shutter speed is typically located on the top left corner, as circled:
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto" src="Nikon-D90-Top.jpg"
        alt="image is loading">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        If your camera does not have a top LCD, like some entry-level DSLRs, you can look through the viewfinder, where
        you will see the shutter speed on the bottom-left side. And if your camera has neither a top LCD nor a
        viewfinder, like many mirrorless cameras, you can see your shutter speed simply by looking on the back screen.
        <br>
        <br>
        On most cameras, shutter speed will not show up directly as a fraction of a second – it will typically be a
        regular number. When the shutter speed is longer than or equal to one second, you will see something like 1” or
        5” (with the quotation sign to indicate a full second).
        <br>
        <br>
        If you still cannot find the shutter speed, set your camera to “Aperture Priority” mode, and make sure that you
        have turned “AUTO ISO” off. Then, start pointing around your camera from dark to bright areas. The number that
        changes will be your shutter speed.
    </p>
    <h3>How Shutter Speed is Measured</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second, when they are under a second. For example 1/4
        means a quarter of a second, while 1/250 means one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of a second (or four
        milliseconds).<br>
        <br>
        Most modern DSLRs and mirrorless cameras can handle shutter speeds of up to 1/4000th of a second, while some can
        handle much quicker speeds of 1/8000th of a second and faster. On the other hand, the longest available shutter
        speed on most DSLRs or mirrorless cameras is typically 30 seconds. You can use a longer shutter speed by using
        external remote triggers, if necessary.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 140%;">
        Aperture and shutter speed are one of the most important concepts in photography and they can do a lot to change
        the look of your photo. This is written mostly for users of SLR (single lens reflex) prosumer cameras with
        aperture and shutter speed controls. I will be using highly simplified diagrams for the purpose of illustrating
        the general concept.<br>
        <br>
        How do you identify them? Now, if you have a camera with aperture and shutter speed controls
        (a mode dial with PASM or P/Tv/Av/M) and you take it outside and half-press the shutter, two numbers should pop
        up: One might have an fin front of it (ie. f3.5) or it will be a decimal of sorts (ie. 4.0). That number is the
        aperture. The other number (if you're outside) should be larger, say around 200-4,000. That's the shutter
        speed.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Aperture: </b><br>
        The aperture is the size of the lens opening. It controls the amount of light let in: a larger
        aperture lets in more light, while a smaller aperture lets in less light.An aperture is made out of aperture
        blades (usually five to nine) that form a rough circle to control the size of theopening, and therefore the
        amount of light let in. The size of the opening is that f/number that I described earlier. Basically, that
        f/number is a ratio of focal length to aperture diameter. Do you need to know this? Not really, except you
        should keep inmind that the aperture is a ratio.Simply put, the smaller the f/number, the larger the opening
        (f/3.5 = 1/3.5 = 0.286; f/16 = 1/16 = 0.0625). That's all I'm going to explain here because it's an extremely
        complicated topic and you don't really need to know it. There's plenty of places on the web that explain it in
        great scientific detail; this is not one of them. The following is a diagram of f-stops. Each f-stop (or just a
        stop) lets in half the amount of light of the previous f-stop.

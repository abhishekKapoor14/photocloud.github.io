    <h2>Photography Basics:<span class=text-muted>Complete beginner's Guide</span></h2>
    <br>
    <p class=lead> Photography isn’t the only way to capture the world, but it certainly is one of the most effective.
        Look no further than the nearest social media feed, news station, magazine article, or book cover to see it –
        photographs have power. If you want to harness that power and learn how to take the best possible photos,
        welcome to “Photography Basics: Complete Beginner’s Guide.” This comprehensive tutorial explains the fundamental
        concepts you should know about photography from start to finish</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why We Wrote “Photography Basics”</h2>
    <p class=lead>
        Where would you go if you wanted to learn the most important basics of photography, starting from scratch?
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, many people today like learning about photography online, which is a great way to search through large
        amounts of information (and carry a reference in your pocket). But as good as the internet is for answering
        questions, it’s not always geared toward studying a large topic from start to finish.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Where to begin</h2>
    <br>
    <p class=lead>Photography Basics is like a book, and it reads from front to back. Each chapter of the guide builds
        on prior chapters. If you start at the very beginning and work your way through, the information will flow
        naturally and in the right order. However, if you want to learn something more specific, you’re welcome to skip
        ahead to a later chapter. Here is the overall organization of the guide:</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is Photography??</h2>
    <p class=lead>
        Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an
        image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye,
        including UV, infrared, and radio.<br>
        <br>
        The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in
        France. It shows the roof of a building lit by the sun. You can see it reproduced below:</p>

    <p class=align-center>“View from the Window at Le Gras” by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce"</p>
    <br>
    <h2>At the beginner level you all need only a Dslr camera with kit-lens,at this level you will learn the basic
        fundamentals of photography like Handling, Framing, Color composition, Basic rules of capturing a moment,Light
        etc</h2>
    <br>

        alt="framing+color composition">
    <br>
    <h2>At intermediate Point, What Other Camera Gear and Accessories Do You Need?</h2>
    <br>
    <p class=lead><b>Camera:</b> If you buy a dedicated camera (rather than a phone), pick one with interchangeable
        lenses so that
        you can try out different types of photography more easily. Read reviews, but don’t obsess over them, because
        everything available today is pretty much equally good as its competition. Find a nice deal and move on.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class=lead><b>Lenses:</b> This is where it counts. For everyday photography, start with a standard zoom lens like
        a 24-70mm or 18-55mm. For portrait photography, pick a prime lens (one that doesn’t zoom) at 35mm, 50mm, or
        85mm. For sports, go with a telephoto lens. For macro photography, get a dedicated macro lens. And so on. Lenses
        matter more than any other piece of equipment because they determine what photos you can take in the first
        place.</p>
    <p class=lead><b>Post Processing Software:</b> One way or another, you need to edit your photos. It’s ok to start
        with software already on your computer, or software that comes with your camera. But in the long run, a
        dedicated program will do a better job. Adobe sells Lightroom and Photoshop as a bundle for $10/month, or you
        can buy standalone software from another company if you prefer; there are tons of options. Whatever you pick,
        stick with it for a while, and you’ll learn it quite well.</p>
    <h3>Everything else is optional, but can be very helpful:</h3>
    <h4><b>1.Tripod</b></h4>
    <h4><b>2.Bags</b></h4>
    <h4><b>3.Memory cards</h4>
    <p class=lead>Choose something in the 32-64 GB range to start. Get a fast card (measured in MB/second) if you shoot
        bursts of photos, since your camera’s memory will clear faster.</b></p>
    <h4><b>4.Extra batteries</b></h4>
    <p class=lead>Get at least one spare battery to start, preferably two. Off-brand batteries are usually cheaper,
        although they may not last as long or maintain compatibility with future cameras.</p>
    <h4><b>5.Polarizing filters</b></h4>
    <h4><b>6.Flash</b></h4>
    <h4><b>7.Cleaning kit</b></h4>
    <br>
    <h2>The Three Fundamental Camera Settings You Should Know</h2>
    <br>
    <p class=lead>Your camera has dozens of buttons and menu options. If you pick the wrong camera settings, it’s
        possible that your photo won’t turn out the way you want. How do you make sense of all these options? And how do
        you do it quickly in the field?
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s not easy, but it’s easier than you might think. In fact, most of the menu options are things you’ll only
        set one time, then rarely or never touch again. Only a handful of settings need to be changed frequently, and
        that’s what the rest of this Photography Basics guide covers.
        <br>
        <br>
        The three most important settings are called shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. All three of them control the
        brightness of your photo, although they do so in different ways. In other words, each brings its own “side
        effects” to an image. So, it’s a bit of an art to know exactly how to balance all three for a given photo.</p>

    <h3><strong>1.Shutter speed:</strong></h3>
    <p class=lead>The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the world while taking a picture.

    <hr class="featurette-divider my-6">
    <h3><strong>2.Aperture</strong></h3>
    <p class=lead>Represents a “pupil” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of light.

    <br>
    <hr class="featurette-divider my-6">
    <h3><strong>3.ISO</strong></h3>
    <p class=lead>Technically a bit more complex, but similar to the sensitivity of film for taking pictures in
        different lighting conditions.

    <br>
    <h3>The First Steps on Your Photographic Journey</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In photography, the technical and the creative go hand in hand.<br>
        <br>
        Remember the Ansel Adams quote from earlier? There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept. If
        the idea behind a photo is weak, using the right camera settings won’t make it better.<br>
        <br>
        At the same time, camera settings are some of the most important tools you have at your disposal. In a way,
        every technical choice is really an artistic choice in disguise. These settings are worth learning. Your
        understanding of photography will improve tenfold when you understand how camera settings work.<br>
